Following dependencies must be installed on your machine (for running main.py)
- Run `pip install requests` to download the requests library
- Run `pip install bs4` to download the bs4 library


But python has a library for this LMAO 🤦‍♂️   😂
For running ultramain.py
- Run `pip install instaloader` to download the instaloader library 

Sorry for naming commit messsage for main.py as "only commit". I did not realise the fact thay python can have library for such things too. I thought main.py would do the thing.
